# New-York-Home-Search

[Demo Site](https://4mber.github.io/New-York-Home-Search/)
 
This is a demonstration of a realty app. There are 6 example listings here, limited to NYC, but it could be easily customized to show listings (including prices, contact info., etc.) from a database for any area.
This app relies heavily on the Google Maps API.
