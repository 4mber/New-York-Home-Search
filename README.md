# New-York-Home-Search
 
This is a demonstration of a realty app. There are 6 example listings here, limited to NYC, but it could be easily customized to show listings (including prices, contact info., etc.) from a database for any area. This app relies heavily on the Google Maps API, giving the user many different ways to find what they are looking for.
